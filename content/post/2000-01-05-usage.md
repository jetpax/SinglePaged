Alright, you've got a clean copy and are ready to push some schmancy pages for the world to ogle at.

- Edit `config.toml` to change your title, keywords, and description.
- Create a new file in `posts/` called `2015-01-01-intro.md`
  Edit it, and add:

{{< highlight text >}}
---
title: "home"
bg: white     #defined in _config.yml, can use html color like '#010101'
color: black  #text color
style: center
date: "2015-01-01"
slug: "about time"
---

# Example headline!
and so on..
{{< /highlight >}}

- Create a second post called `2015-01-02-art.md` with an divider image this time:

{{< highlight text >}}
---
title: "Art"
bg: turquoise  #defined in _config.yml, can use html color like '#0fbfcf'
color: white   #text color
fa-icon: paint-brush
date: "2015-01-02"
slug: "about time"
---

#### A new section- oh the humanity!
{{< /highlight >}}

**Note:** That part `fa-icon: paint-brush` will use a font-awesome icon of [paint-brush](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icon/paint-brush/). You can use any icon from this [font-awesome icon directory](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/).

- install Hugo with `brew install hugo`
- run `hugo server --watch' 
  - visit [localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313) to see a live locally served preview.
- Push changes and see them live!




## **Changing your colors**  



- In each post file you can define `bg: mycolor` and `color: myothercolor` to change the background and text colors for that section.

Nifty, right!
